/*
C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you a lot of control
in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.

C++ progrmaming gives oyu a clear understaning about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand
low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers,
or dynamic type identification.

C++ is one of the every green progrmaming languages and loved by millions of software developerss.
If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get
highly paid for your work

C++ is the most widely used progrmaming languages in applicaiton and system progrmaming. 
So you can choose your area of interest of software developement 

C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types thier scopes etc.

/*
Standard C++ consitst of three important parts -
    - The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data typs and literals. etc
    - The C+ Standrad Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, string , etc.
    - The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structure

//The ANSI Standard
/*
The ANSI standard is an atempt to ensure that C++ is portable; that code you write for Microsoft's 
compiler will compie without errors, using a compier on a Mac, UNIX, a Window box, or an Alpha.

The ANSI standard has been stable for a while, and all the major C++ compier manufacturers suppots the ANSI standard.
